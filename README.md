[Gelblaster](https://gelblaster.com) XL "Wingman" robotic turret mod inspired by U.S. Army [TARDEC](https://asc.army.mil/web/news-alt-jfm18-wingman-is-first-step-toward-weaponized-robotics/), [Open Robotics](https://www.openrobotics.org) [ROS-M](https://rosmilitary.org/faq/) & GVSC [RTK](https://vimeo.com/593277076?).

Designed by Kevin Finisterre, & John Cherbini with assistance from Gelblaster design team. 

Ever since I saw James Cameron's "Aliens" in 1986, and Frank Marshall's "Congo" in 1995 I knew I needed to own an automated sentry turret at some point in my life. It wasn't clear I'd eventually be sharing the design to one for others to use, but I sit, doing exactly that.

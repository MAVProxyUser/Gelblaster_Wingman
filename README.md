## Introduction

[Gelblaster](https://gelblaster.com) XL "Wingman" is robotic turret, that shoots Super Absorbant Polymer balls at targets as selected by AI logic. The "Gelblaster turret SDK" was inspired by U.S. Army [TARDEC](https://asc.army.mil/web/news-alt-jfm18-wingman-is-first-step-toward-weaponized-robotics/) - Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, [Open Robotics](https://www.openrobotics.org) [ROS-M](https://rosmilitary.org/faq/) military fork of Robot Operation System from GVSC - Combat Capabilities Development Command Ground Vehicle Systems Center. Functionality seeks to mimic concepts found in the [RTK](https://vimeo.com/593277076?) - Robotic Technology Kernel program.

The Wingman (game) concept was designed by Kevin Finisterre, tested, & developed by John Cherbini with assistance from Gelblaster the design team. 

## Synopsis 

Ever since I saw James Cameron's "Aliens" in 1986, and Frank Marshall's "Congo" in 1995 I knew I needed to own an automated sentry turret at some point in my life. It wasn't clear I'd eventually be sharing the design to one for others to use, but I sit, doing exactly that.

"Wingman" is a ![CC BY-NC-SA ](https://licensebuttons.net/l/by-nc-sa/3.0/88x31.png) licensed Open Source "GelBlaster" turret for ["general-purpose robots"](https://www.bostondynamics.com/open-letter-opposing-weaponization-general-purpose-robots). Built with gamification of non-lethal adversarial Gelblaster sparring matches in mind, "wingman" makes marksmanship a key comonent of playtime.
